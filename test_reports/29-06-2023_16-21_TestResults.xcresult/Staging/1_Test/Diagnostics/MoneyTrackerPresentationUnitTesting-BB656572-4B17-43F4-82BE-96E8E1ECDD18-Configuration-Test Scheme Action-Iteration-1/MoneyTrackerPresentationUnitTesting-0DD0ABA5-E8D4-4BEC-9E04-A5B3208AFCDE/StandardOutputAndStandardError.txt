	Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. 
	Try this: 
		(1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; 
		(2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. 
	(Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)

2023-06-29 16:22:31.194755+0800 xctest[86386:53647160] [TableView] Warning once only: UITableView was told to layout its visible cells and other contents without being in the view hierarchy (the table view or one of its superviews has not been added to a window). This may cause bugs by forcing views inside the table view to load and perform layout without accurate information (e.g. table view bounds, trait collection, layout margins, safe area insets, etc), and will also cause unnecessary performance overhead due to extra layout passes. Make a symbolic breakpoint at UITableViewAlertForLayoutOutsideViewHierarchy to catch this in the debugger and see what caused this to occur, so you can avoid this action altogether if possible, or defer it until the table view has been added to a window. Table view: <UITableView: 0x156025600; frame = (0 0; 32 192); clipsToBounds = YES; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x600002026520>; backgroundColor = UIExtendedSRGBColorSpace 0.106 0.11 0.118 1; layer = <CALayer: 0x600002ee9f80>; contentOffset: {0, 0}; contentSize: {32, 0}; adjustedContentInset: {0, 0, 0, 0}; dataSource: (null)>
